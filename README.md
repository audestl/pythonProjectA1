To run this program, first, you need to download and install Numpy and Scikit-learn on your machine.
Follow the steps at this link:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
https://numpy.org/install/


After that, open your favorite IDE and simply select the model (i.e GaussianNB.py) you would
like to run in your IDE and run it.
It will create two files:
    - A file with the performance results for the dataset1
    - A file with the performance results for the dataset2
The program should then exit with exit code 0.
